General Information
MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing and managing structured data. It offers robust features for creating, managing, and querying databases.

How to Create a New MySQL User
Creating a new MySQL user involves the following steps:

Login to MySQL: Access MySQL using a command-line interface or a graphical tool like phpMyAdmin.
Run SQL Command: Execute the CREATE USER command followed by the username and password.
sql
Copy code
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Grant Privileges: Grant necessary privileges to the user using the GRANT statement.
sql
Copy code
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
How to Manage Privileges for a User to a Database or Table
To manage privileges for a user in MySQL:

Grant Privileges: Use the GRANT statement to assign specific privileges to a user.
Revoke Privileges: Use the REVOKE statement to remove privileges from a user.
View Privileges: Query the information_schema database to view user privileges.
What's a PRIMARY KEY
A PRIMARY KEY is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures data integrity and serves as the default clustering index for the table.

What's a FOREIGN KEY
A FOREIGN KEY is a column or a combination of columns that establishes a link between data in two tables. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key or unique key column(s) of another table.

How to Use NOT NULL and UNIQUE Constraints
NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.
UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column (or a combination of columns) are unique.
How to Retrieve Data from Multiple Tables in One Request
You can retrieve data from multiple tables using:

Joins: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
Subqueries: Execute a query nested within another query to retrieve data from multiple tables.
UNION: Combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.
What are Subqueries
Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are queries nested within another query. They allow you to retrieve data based on the results of another query.

What are JOIN and UNION
JOIN: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
UNION: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set, eliminating duplicate rows.
