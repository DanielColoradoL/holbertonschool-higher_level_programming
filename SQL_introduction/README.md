MySQL Database Basics
General
This README provides a basic understanding of MySQL databases, SQL, and essential operations within MySQL.

What’s a Database?
A database is an organized collection of structured data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for easy retrieval, management, and manipulation of data.

What’s a Relational Database?
A relational database organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established through keys, enabling efficient querying and data management.

What does SQL Stand for?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

What’s MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. It is widely used for various applications, ranging from small-scale web applications to large-scale enterprise systems.

How to Create a Database in MySQL
To create a database in MySQL, you can use the CREATE DATABASE statement followed by the database name. For example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
What does DDL and DML Stand for?
DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which includes commands for defining and modifying database structures, such as creating tables (CREATE TABLE) and altering their structure (ALTER TABLE).

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which includes commands for managing data within the database, such as inserting (INSERT INTO), updating (UPDATE), and deleting (DELETE FROM) records.

How to CREATE or ALTER a Table
To create a new table in MySQL, you can use the CREATE TABLE statement followed by the table name and column definitions. For example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);
To alter an existing table, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement followed by the table name and the alteration you want to make. For example:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
How to SELECT Data from a Table
To select data from a table in MySQL, you can use the SELECT statement followed by the columns you want to retrieve and the table name. For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM mytable;
How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE Data
To insert data into a table, you can use the INSERT INTO statement. For example:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO mytable (name, age) VALUES ('John', 30);
To update existing data, you can use the UPDATE statement. For example:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE mytable SET age = 35 WHERE name = 'John';
To delete data from a table, you can use the DELETE FROM statement. For example:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM mytable WHERE name = 'John';
What Are Subqueries
Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are queries nested within another query. They are used to retrieve data based on the results of another query.

How to Use MySQL Functions
MySQL provides various built-in functions for performing operations on data. These functions can be used in SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data in different ways. Examples of MySQL functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, CONCAT, SUBSTRING, etc.
