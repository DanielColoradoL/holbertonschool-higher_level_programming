This document provides an overview of Python variables, objects, mutability, references, and related concepts.

Objects
In Python, an object is a data structure that contains data (attributes or properties) and code (methods) to manipulate that data.

Class vs. Object or Instance
Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.
Object/Instance: An object or instance is a concrete realization of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own data and behavior.
Immutable vs. Mutable Objects
Immutable Object: An object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.
Mutable Object: An object whose state can be modified after it is created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
Reference and Assignment
Reference: A reference is a value that refers to an object in memory.
Assignment: Assignment is the process of binding a name to an object.
Alias and Identical Variables
Alias: An alias is when two or more variables refer to the same object.
Identical Variables: Two variables are identical if they refer to the same object in memory.
Displaying Variable Identifier
To display the memory address (variable identifier) of an object in CPython implementation, you can use the id() function.

Mutable and Immutable Types
Mutable Types: Types whose objects can be changed after creation. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
Immutable Types: Types whose objects cannot be changed after creation. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.
Built-in Mutable Types
Built-in mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Built-in Immutable Types
Built-in immutable types in Python include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

Passing Variables to Functions
Python passes variables to functions using a mechanism called "pass by object reference." This means that a reference to the object is passed to the function, allowing the function to access and modify the object if it is mutable.

This README provides an overview of Python variables, objects, mutability, references, and related concepts. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and effective Python code.
